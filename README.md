This project demonstrates how to automate the process of handling multiple browser windows or tabs using Selenium WebDriver in Python.
It showcases switching between a parent window and a child window, retrieving text content, and validating window content — a common automation need when dealing with pop-ups, external links, or new tab navigation.
