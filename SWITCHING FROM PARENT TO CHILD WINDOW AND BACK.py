Project Title: Selenium Automation â€“ Switching Between Parent & Child Windows/Tabs

Description:
This project demonstrates how to handle multiple browser windows/tabs using Selenium WebDriver in Python.
It covers switching control from a parent window to a newly opened child window, extracting data from it,
and then switching back to the parent window. This is a common automation scenario for testers and QA engineers
when working with applications that open popups or external links.

Key Skills & Concepts:
- Selenium WebDriver automation
- Handling multiple windows/tabs
- Using window handles for navigation
- Locating elements with different locators (By.LINK_TEXT, By.TAG_NAME)
- Python scripting for QA automation
- Basic synchronization using time.sleep()

Use Case:
Many real-world applications open new browser tabs or pop-up windows for forms, payment gateways, or documentation.
Automating the process of switching between these windows ensures smooth end-to-end testing and validation.

Tools & Technologies:
- Python 3.x
- Selenium WebDriver
- Google Chrome Browser
- ChromeDriver
